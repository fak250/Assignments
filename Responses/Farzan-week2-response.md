It was very interesting to see the difference between thinking of time and progress linearly and in an exponential way. We tend to apply this logic when estimating the time it will take us to do a specific thing in daily life too. I realized this specifically when working on my capstone. Learning a new skill would take a lot of time but then applying it and building on it would be a much faster process. I also found the distinction between the tasks that humans have to think about and the ones they can do without thinking to be surprising in the sense of the latter being harder to do for a computer. It was also interesting to see that the distorted view carried forward from time/progress into that of intelligence. Combining the two means that if computers become as smart as dumb humans, we will appreciate that but because progress is exponential, it will take them a very small amount of time to match Einstein level intelligence.
