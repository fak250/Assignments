It is very interesting to see the way the history of creativity was structured in the article. It seemed like every breakthrough that came about came as a result of people using current breakthroughs to push the boundaries and see what can come out of it. I think it was very important of them to address the automation vs augmentation confusion and the illustration of the horse rider really helped clear up the confusion for me personally. They also addressed the concerns that many people have with automation but while reading the article I had more questions about it and would have liked to see a more in-depth analysis of the problem. Lastly, I found the phrase, “Democratization of Creativity” to be really interesting. The concept of generative design and the publishing of processes instead of just the final product is something that is aiding the democratization of creativity.
